The project was built with students from Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design at Hack@Brown 2016. Due to time constraints, the project could not be completed at the event, but all of the physical components were designed and built on site.

In our final project for the Harvard University class CS171, Data Visualzation, our team extracted data on an individual's use of Facebook Messenger and built a series of visualizations of said data (including message length, message volume, and ratio of sent/received messages over time, as well as a visualization of summary statistics). The project was built for both web and desktop using the Electron framework."

I took on the challenge on my own over the course of the summer, building the brand from the ground up and developing the ideas of the hackathon in terms of its overall mission, type, color scheme, and visual identity. I also worked with Eric Timmerman to design and build the website (http://www.hackharvard.io). The full process of the rebranding can be found at https://www.behance.net/gallery/45648499/HackHarvard-Rebranding."

The robot was required to collect spherical game pieces and deliver them to a series of basketball hoops at the top of a slope. It could also drive up an uneven terrain slope for additional points. \n We successfully built our robot to complete all given objectives. My domain of expertise on the team was the drivetrain of the robot. I also made 3D models of all components in Solidworks and created high quality renders of the assembly."

        "description": "Three-dimensional models of kidney tissue that recapitulate human responses are needed for drug screening, disease modeling, and, ultimately, kidney organ engineering. Here, we report a bioprinting method for creating 3D human renal proximal tubules in vitro that are fully embedded within an extracellular matrix and housed in perfusable tissue chips, allowing them to be maintained for greater than two months. Their convoluted tubular architecture is circumscribed by proximal tubule epithelial cells and actively perfused through the open lumen. These engineered 3D proximal tubules on chip exhibit significantly enhanced epithelial morphology and functional properties relative to the same cells grown on 2D controls with or without perfusion. The research is published in Scientific Reports and was completed with the expertise of Dr. Kim Homan, Dr. David Kolesky, and Dr. Mark Scott."
